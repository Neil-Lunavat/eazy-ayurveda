    {
        question: "What is Shilajit?",
        answer: "Shilajit is a natural substance found primarily in the Himalayas, formed over centuries by the decomposition of plant material. It's rich in fulvic acid and minerals, traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to promote vitality and overall health. Our Shilajit is sourced from the highest mountains to ensure purity and potency.",
    },
    {
        question: "How should I take Shilajit?",
        answer: "Take a pea-sized amount (approximately 300-500mg) and dissolve it in warm water, milk, or tea. It's recommended to consume once or twice daily, preferably in the morning and/or evening. For best results, take consistently as part of your daily wellness routine.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are there any side effects?",
        answer: "When taken as directed, Shilajit typically doesn't cause side effects in most people. However, individuals with certain conditions like hemochromatosis (iron overload) should consult with a healthcare professional before use. Pregnant or nursing women should also seek medical advice before taking Shilajit.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to see results?",
        answer: "While some users report experiencing an energy boost within days, the full benefits of Shilajit are often realized with consistent use over 4-8 weeks. As with most natural supplements, results may vary from person to person depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and consistency of use.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is your Shilajit tested for purity?",
        answer: "Yes, our Shilajit undergoes rigorous testing for purity, potency, and safety. We ensure it's free from contaminants, heavy metals, and adulterants, providing you with the highest quality product for your wellness journey. Our testing processes meet international standards for herbal supplements.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I take Shilajit with other supplements or medications?",
        answer: "Generally, Shilajit can be taken alongside most supplements. However, if you're taking prescription medications, especially blood thinners or medications for diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid conditions, we recommend consulting your healthcare provider before adding Shilajit to your regimen.",
